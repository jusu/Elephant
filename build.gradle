// Things to improve:
// 1. dependancies from mavenCentral
// 2. make jar files working, currently need some more adjusting
// 3. make documentaton for build process (gradle build, gradle run + also can import as gradle project to eclipse)
// 4. put test folder inside project
// 5. put sikuli somewhere. must think how
// 6. also there was some talks about gradle wrapper and circleci must look them also
